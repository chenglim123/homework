I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

My group consisted of 2 adults and a child. None of us were particularly hungry so we ordered one lunch off the Restaurant week menu and a mac and cheese. The waitress said that we could not share so I told her we were not going to share. After talking to her manager she came back to question what my boyfriend would be eating and after he responded that he would just be nibbling off mine she again told us there was a strict no sharing policy and that sharing would not be allowed. So we went to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill instead where they had no policy against sharing.\\n\\nI was very disappointed with Max Brenner and do not understand the purpose of such policy.  Isn't the primary point of Restaurant Week to support fighting hunger in Las Vegas? The policy feels like they are primarily using Restaurant week to help themselves.

Mine came to the table 5 minutes after my wife's and when I bit into it it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen and 5 minutes later it was re-served cold again. Besides the temperature, the meat was very tough to cut. At that point we gave up after registering our complaint with the manager. He asked if I wanted something else but by this time I had no confidence in the kitchen. My wife's meal was fair at best. She said her food was tasteless and not very fresh.
